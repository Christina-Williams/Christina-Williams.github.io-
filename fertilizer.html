<h3>Chemical Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Chemical fertilizers are a byproduct of fossil fuels. When gas prices go up there is a ripple effect for the food industry. Not only does the transport cost rise, the cost of growing the food with chemical fertilizers aslo increases. The other issue with chemical fertilizers is that they don't live in the soil. Rather than incorporating into the soil web, the fertilizer is washed away over time and accumulates in ground water. Growers have to reapply chemical fertilizers, making for an excellent commodity market, but increasing reliance on imported goods and decreasing profits for growers. The benefits of chemical fertilizers are short-term. They do work, but at a high cost for our communities and environment.

<h3>Organic Fertilizers</h3>
<p>Organic fertilizing is a natural, closed loop system designed by nature. As the leaves fall, nutrients are recycled back into the soil feeding microorganisms that help plants grow. Inputs to organic fertilizer products are stable and sustainable.Cultivating crops naturally may take longer to get started, but it is more sustainable in the long run. </p>
