<h3>What is food security?</h3>
<p>In simple terms food security refers to having reliable, consistent access to nutritious foods. In the United States, we only consume about half of our food. The other half of our food supply is landfilled(55%), composted(12%), or recycled by other biological process(33%). When food waste is sent to landills, the nutrients in the food cannot be made available to new plants. Over time, the foods that we consume have lost nutrient density. A study from UT Austin concluded reliable declines in nutrition for 43 fruit and vegetable varieties from 1943-1999.</p>

<h3>How can we increase food security?</h3>
<p>Purchasing only the food we require and composting leftovers is a great first step in closing the "loop" in our food system. Clickbait headlines warning of food shortages don't get to the root of the problems we face. We can grow and transport 10 oranges, and still not have the nutrient density of an orange from 1943, especially when you factor in that 5 of those oranges will never be consumed. Waste reduction and nutrient recycling via composting over time, will replace the nutrients that our soil so desparately needs after decades of monocrop agriculture. <br><br>
Transitioning to locally produced food suppliers is a great way to support sustainable systems. Keep in mind, organic farming certification is not easy for small gardeners, so don't shy away from farmer's market produce because it's not certified organic. Most farmers will happily tell you their process for producing crops. Smaller operations likely don't use large quantiites of chemical fertilizers. Last but not least, consider growing your own garden. It's an immersive experience that offers many benefits like exercise, time in nature and a truly enjoyable, unique learning opportunity.</P>
